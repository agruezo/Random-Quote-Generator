<h1 align="center">üêç Random Quote Generator üêç</h1>

This is my first project that involved test driven development from start to finish. A CI/CD pipeline was set up for a Python package published to PyPI. Code on each branch is checked with tests and code quality. Code coverage can be checked inside CodeCov. On releases, new versions are deployed to PyPI and the docs are updated.
